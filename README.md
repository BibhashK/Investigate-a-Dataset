# Investigate-a-Dataset
Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree project - 3


Project Overview
In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

Prepare for this project with: Intro to Data Analysis

What do I need to install?
You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* csv
We recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook. You can find installation instructions here.

Why this Project?
In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will:

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up your data analysis code
Be familiar with Pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
